# Food recommendation agent

This project implements an Agentic AI-powered restaurant ordering assistant that provides user with personalized recommendations which align with users' nutritional needs and preferences.

Key Features:
- Health Data Integration: Collects and analyzes user health metrics (age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, dietary restrictions, etc.) to provide personalized meal recommendations
- User Preference Customization: Allows users to set dietary goals, cuisine preferences, and budget ranges for tailored recommendations
- Interactive Interface: Features a modern chat interface with styled message bubbles for natural conversation, plus a dedicated health & preferences tab for easy profile management
- Health & Preference-Aware Recommendations: Provides intelligent dish suggestions based on nutritional needs and user preferences, with clear price breakdowns including tax and tips
- Visual Previews: Generates AI-powered images of recommended dishes to help users visualize their potential meals
- Health Guidance: Offers personalized health advice to support informed menu choices as well as assisting user to make additional orders


Notes
- The project uses AutoGen for agent build
- The agent uses Selenium for web automation
- Health data is stored in CSV format
- The UI is built using Streamlit

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Setup miniconda with python 3.12
   ```bash
   conda create --name what_to_eat python=3.12
   conda activate what_to_eat
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Install Chrome Browser and ChromeDriver
   - Ensure that the Chrome browser is installed on your system.
   - Install ChromeDriver, which is required for Selenium-based implementations. 
     - Make sure the version of ChromeDriver is compatible with your installed version of Chrome.
     - To check your Chrome version, you can refer to [this guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+find+chrome+version).
     - Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from [Chrome for Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).
     - After downloading, replace the existing ChromeDriver in your project directory with the new one.
   - If applicable, ensure you have the appropriate API keys for any cloud services you plan to use.
   - After placing the ChromeDriver in the correct directory, run the following command in your terminal to make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x chromedriver
     ```

7. Install Tesseract OCR (required for menu processing):
   - On macOS: `brew install tesseract`
   - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - On Windows: Download and install from [Tesseract GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

8. Run the application:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   streamlit run src/ui/app.py
   ```
